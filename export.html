Nationwide, we are rising to the challenge, building an unstoppable network and movement, locally and nationally, to pass and ratify a powerful amendment to United States Constitution so that people, not money govern America.  Join us at the National Citizen Leadership Conference (NCLC) to see how we can achieve this urgent, historic reform. Come away empowered, knowing that together, we can amplify our message in communities, statehouses and Congress. It’s time take on super PACs and special interests to get money out of politics by passing the 28th Amendment.  The National Citizen Leadership Conference is where and how we crank this historic movement up. The NCLC is for every American. We’ll celebrate amazing victories and citizen leaders. We’ll share and learn how to effectively take action together and in our communities. We’ll learn from experts, and from each other. We’ll build powerful connections with elected officials, candidates, national leaders, the media, and our fellow citizen leaders. We’ll have fun, too! And we will take our voice and citizen power straight to Congress with an organized Lobby Day before we leave Washington!        </p><hr /><h1>Page Title: The Facts</h1><p>   The Facts  50  STATES    60  This is not a drill.

American Promise is hosting conversations with Americans across the nation about what the 28th Amendment should include. Writing an amendment isn’t easy, but we can do it. Watch these videos and photos of some of those discussions from the NCLC, on everything from how to make the 28th the first citizen-written amendment to Constitutional Convention pros and cons.

The citizen-led 28th Amendment process will include the voices of all Americans—citizens of all ages, genders, races, sexual orientations, backgrounds, belief systems and political persuasions. At the NCLC we aimed to foster the inclusivity of this movement with programming focused on the real-world impacts of the undue influence of money in communities across our nation; the critical nature of ensuring diversity; and the power of the rising generation of American voters.

 </p><hr /><h1>Page Title: We the People; United We Stand</h1><p> We The People  Our movement comprises organizations across political parties and with many goals.   Dozens of committed organizations across our great nation are working tirelessly to fix the fundamental problem with big money in politics. We are honored to host and corral the efforts and beliefs of these many groups at the NCLC, the meeting ground where we come together to get energized and further our important work together.

Our members conducted more than 70 meetings in one day to talk about this critical issue. Read more about our Lobby Day efforts.   Lobby Day
